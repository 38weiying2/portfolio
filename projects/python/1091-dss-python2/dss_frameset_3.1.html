				<center><h2>主題:酒類建議系統<br>Topic : Wine Recommendation</h2></center>
				<h2>1.	Motivation</h2>
				<p>
				When you are a waiter who works in a restaurant, which offers drinks to guests, you may have to recommend the drinks to your customer according to their preferences. To recommend the drinks meeting the customers’ preferences, you have to remember all the features of each drinks you have and describe to your customer. So, we want to  let our wine recommendation system help these waiters to do recommendation to customer without lots of memory work.
				</p><br><br>
				<h2>2.	Literature review</h2>
				<p>
				Using online wine recommendation system as literature review<br>
				>> 微醺九號 http://www.tipsy-9.com/bartender.html<br><br>
				There are some wine recommendation apps like Vivino, Delectable, Wine Searcher and Cell Wine. Their common advantage is they all have pictures, which can make users clearer. However, they also have a common problem is that they are mainly used in Europe and America, Asians are less aware of these apps.
				</p><br><br>
				<h2>3.	Introduction of our system</h2>
				<p>
				Step1. Data pre-processing and user selection <br>
				Step2. Cluster Analysis - K-Means<br>
				Step3. Machine learning<br>
				Step4. Word Cloud - for more options<br><br>

				At first, we clean the data which we got from Kaggle, there’s about one hundred and thirty thousand amounts of our row data, after we drop the rows which has blank cells, our data has around ten thousand rows in it. 
				<br><img src="images/dss1.png" width="80%">
				<br>Then we use cluster analysis to classify our data to group and we use elbow method of K-means to find the most suitable k. The variables we used are country, variety, province and taster_name.
				<br><img src="images/dss2.png" width="40%">
				<br>And we can find out 2 is the biggest turning point between the slope, it means split the data to 2 group is the most suitable for our feature data.
				<br>Therefore, we take Logistic regression, SVM and Decision tree these three ways of machine learning to train the models. We spilt the data to 70% and 30% for training data and testing data. At the result, we get 99%, 77% and 100% of the machine learning output above.
				<br>In order to help the user, system will let user choose the country, variety, point and price of the wine in the prompt list, to find the wine which is more appropriate with the require from the user,
				<br><img src="images/dss3.png" width="30%">
				<br>After the selection, we will get the recommendation from the system.
				<br><img src="images/dss4.png" width="100%">
				<br>At the same time, we also make the word cloud for group that user input data belongs to, we can show the alcoholic beverages recommend list from user choose variable data, and let user choose a word from the cloud, then show the recommend list in word cloud of user choose that in description.
				</p><br><br>
				
				<h2>4.	Operating procedures</h2>
				<p>First, set up the data direction for two excel files which we attach.
				<br><img src="images/dss5.png" width="65%">
				<br>Then, user input the info of the wine.
				<br>For example:
				<br><img src="images/dss6.png" width="65%">
				<br>Then, there will be a result based on the info user input.
				<br><img src="images/dss4.png" width="100%">
				<br>Second, we use K-means to cluster our data by the user’s input above, and add the group info in to the file.
				<br>Third, after the grouping, then use three models to train and test its accuracy.
				<br>We found that decision tree always has the best accuracy. So we use decision tree to find out what is user input variables belongs to which group.
				<br><br>And next, show the word cloud according to
				<br>(1)	User input variables data: to show user the variety and final result user got.
				<br>(2)	User’s group data
				<br><img src="images/dss8.png" width="40%">
				<br>User choose variable is about the input value user input above, we took the input value and calculate its description, and made the cloud.
				<br><br>Then, system will show the similar alcoholic beverages recommend list from user group and the alcoholic beverages recommend list from user choose variable data.
				<br><br>At the end, system will give recommend list base on
				<br>(1)	user groups: show the similar alcoholic beverages recommend list
				<br>(2)	user choose variable data 
				<br>(3)	a word in word cloud from user choose variable data 
				<br>let user choose a word in word cloud, so as to let user see if there has other options to consider.
